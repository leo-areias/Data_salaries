# Data Analysis into Data salaries from around the World in 2023

### Here i will be learning together with any of you that might be interested, during this week i will be updating this notebook with my analysis.
1. The first analysis i did is acctually a new learning path for me, web scraping, i used the Beautiful Soup library to get current values to salaries that are not in USD, and multiply them to the current value of the USD for each unique currency, to establish a unique colum with all the salaries in USD, based on the day you run the code.
